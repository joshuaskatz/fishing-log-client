This app was designed as the client side for a fishing-related database I created with PostgresQL and GraphQL. This is essentially a log where users can visualize data from the database in a neat, organized fashion.

Built using the React framework, this project utilized packages such as Apollo Client, React Hook Form, and React Bootstrap. Relying heavily on React hooks, the app helped me further my understanding of the React hook syntax and core concepts.
